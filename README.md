### Description
MyPlugin is aimed at bringing some RP features for players.
I might want to add later pickups that will change you to some role
- RP servers use this as they're way to give roles to players.
Features can be edited or added by suggestion of players so 100% suggest something I might make it.

This plugin is mainly for RP servers without developers.

### Custom Items
You can edit one of the 1 placeholder custom item (More will be added) and 2 examples Taser, SCP-035.

You do not have to know more because there is literally nothing more
This will be expanded in future maybe people could create their own items will see.

### Custon Roles
SCP-035 exists but me lazy so no config

### Custom Emotes

Okay this is the greatest feature of them all. You can add your Emotes and edit permissions of those emotes.
SCPs are not in the permissions but enough people would ask for this feature it will be added.

* How to add custom emote?
You simply add them by having somewhere in your schematic name `!`.

How can I change permission of Emote?
You can change it by adding somewhere in your schematic name 2 letters like in example:

* This could only use Class-D
```cs
!Broom[CD]
```

* This could only use MTF
```cs
!Shield[NPNSENSPNC]
```

* All permissions are:
```cs
[NONE] everyone have acess to use the Emote even SCPs you
[CD] ClassD have acess to use the Emote
[SC] Scientist have acess to use the Emote
[FG] Facility Guards have acess to use the Emote
[NP] NTF Private have acess to use the Emote
[NSE] NTF Sergeant have acess to use the Emote
[NSP] NTF Specialist have acess to use the Emote

```

### Bin

This plugin mainly uses MER dependency which will also be in releases.

### Door Opening
Door opens only when you press epic door button

You can make people see information who is the owner of keycards
but when someone picks up keycard who does not have owner yet they will be the new owner.
